#                       This is a game where a player tries to guess the number combinations. At the end of each attempt
#                       to guess the 4 number combinations, the computer will provide feedback whether the player had
#                       guess a number correctly, or/and a number and digit correctly. A player must guess the right
#                       number combinations within 10 attempts to win the game.
